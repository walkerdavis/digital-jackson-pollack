## Generate digital pixel splatters with Python and [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)(Python Image Library)

## ![alt text](convergence.png)

### Using Pillow, you can generate digital images inspired by Jackson Pollack.  I chose to imitate Jackon Pollack's 1952 *Convergence* because I like the colors, seemed like a good place to start.  

### This jupyter notebook will show you how to create a painting(really a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org) array), specify your colors, add a border to the image if you'd like, and then save to a .png format.

### Future iterations will not be limited straight lines, hopefully I will incorporate splines soon to get splatters that are more Pollack-esque.  

### The pollack_RUNT directory contains the original project I made this for, using the [RUNT](https://github.com/MuvikLabs/runt) and [Pixku](https://github.com/MuvikLabs/Pixku) languages by my friends at [Muvik Labs](https://muviklabs.github.io).  To run anything in this directory, you will need to install and run RUNT by following the instructions on that repo's README.

### Enjoy.
